# Todo-app-challenge-hub

Welcome to my repository.

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW

Technologies used: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

Project description:

In this project, my main objective was to build a functional Todo app. I've used Tailwind CSS to
create the website mobile-first. The site is fully responsive, adapting to any device. 

I've implemented the following features:
- changing the mode view
- adding a new task
- deleting a task
- completing a task
- drag and drop (it works only for laptops and dekstops tho)
- filter tasks
- counter for tasks
- dynamic scrollbar
- memorizing the application state

It was a challenge to work organized and write clean code. I had a lot of bugs which I eventually
solved, improving debugging skills. I liked the process of building this app because it tested
my problem solving capabilities.
